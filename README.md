# Equinox Analytics Utilities

## Why this package?

It's lightweight and doing a lot of simple tasks we can use in app - so why even break this out?

We are doing the same things in a lot of different ways when it comes to analytics. This package at a bare minimum unifies how and where data is set. It has a level of schema verification so we know what we are setting.

This way the analytics team as a single source of truth to the hows whys and wheres this data management.

From here we can hopefully enhance this package to cover more aspects of the analytics work flow.
