2. run `yarn dev` to run webpack in watch mode. this will capture changes made to this application and update bundle that is served to the connected app through the yarn link
3. cd to the root of the app you wish to connect to and run `yarn link eqx-analytics`
4. start or restart connected app to see the code changes from this repo

## Testing

Test are set up in Jest using JSDOM. Thresholds for coverage currently are not set up but please write test for any new functions. Jest does run on commits in order to help us catch breaking changes.

## Publishing

1. Bump the SemVer appropriately depending on your changes in package.json
2. Make a PR with step 1 and other code changes to master.
3. Once approved - merge, go back to the app, check out master and pull
4. Run `yarn build`
5. Run `npm login` and provide credentials
